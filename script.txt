Begin by finding a comfortable seated position.

Sit with your back straight and your hands resting on your lap. Close your eyes gently, or if you prefer, keep them softly focused on a spot in front of you.

Take a few deep breaths.

Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your lungs to fill with air. Exhale gently through your mouth, letting go of any tension or stress. Repeat this a few times, allowing your breath to anchor you to the present moment.

Now, shift your focus to your breath.

Pay attention to the natural rhythm of your breathing. Notice the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. Feel the rise and fall of your chest or the sensation of the breath in your nostrils.

If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to your breath.

It's normal for thoughts to arise. When they do, acknowledge them without judgment and guide your attention back to your breath. Imagine each thought as a passing cloud in the sky of your mind.

Expand your awareness to your body.

Notice any sensations or areas of tension. Allow your awareness to scan your body from head to toe, releasing any tension you may find. Let go of any need to change or fix anything; simply observe and be present with what is.

Shift your attention to sounds.

Listen to the sounds around you, whether they are near or far. Notice the different tones and volumes without attaching to them. Let the sounds come and go, maintaining your focus on the present moment.

As you approach the last minute, bring awareness back to your breath.

Take a few deeper breaths, recentering your attention. Feel the sensation of the breath, and when you're ready, gently open your eyes.

Take a moment to notice how you feel.

Acknowledge any changes in your mind or body. Carry this sense of mindfulness with you as you continue with your day.
